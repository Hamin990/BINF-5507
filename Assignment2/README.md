# Assignment 2 - Regression and Classification Models

## Project Description
This project is part of Assignment 2 for BIN-5505. The objective is to develop, evaluate, and compare regression and classification models using the **Heart Disease UCI dataset**.

- **Regression Task:** Predict cholesterol levels (target = `chol`)
- **Classification Task:** Predict presence of heart disease (target = `num`)

## Repository Structure

## How to run this script

1. Clone this repository.
2. Install required libraries using:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
   (If needed, include a `requirements.txt` file with pandas, scikit-learn, seaborn, matplotlib, etc.)

3. Open `main.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook or VS Code and run the cells.

git clone https://github.com/Hamin990/BINF-5507.git

## Models 

- Regression: Linear Regression, ElasticNet with hyperparameter tuning.
- Classification: Logistic Regression, k-NN with hyperparameter tuning.
- Evaluation metrics: RÂ², RMSE, Accuracy, F1-score, AUROC, AUPRC.
- Visualizations: Heatmaps for hyperparameter tuning, AUROC and AUPRC curves.
